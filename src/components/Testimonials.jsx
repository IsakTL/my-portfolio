                "I thought Isak was great. Polite and knowledgeable and he listened to what I had to say, even though as an old guy I ramble on annoyingly. I was impressed that he paid enough attention to actually respond thoughtfully to my ramblings. He is also clearly if quietly empathetic, which must make many of his customers feel welcomed--it did me."

                "this question about how likely am I to recommend the store is always asked on these surveys. I am unlikely to recommend any store to anyone, I can't think when anyone has asked me for such a recommendation. But I will honestly take about the great service I've received at the Rosedale store in the past. (And a few slip-ups). But someone told me that if I don't put '5 Extremely likely' here it will be held against the sales clerk or service representative or whatever title you employ. He was great."
