[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/4e237203-c199-46d9-b3d6-026601aefb1d/deploy-status)][1]

This is a showcase of projects I've created. It uses a vite frontend, deployed via Netlify as a static site.

## Instructions
No installation necessary. Site deployed at [https://isakt.netlify.app][1].

## Usage
Click around the site to see why I've been an asset to every former employer.

## Contributing
If you'd like to model your own portfolio after mine, feel free. This app uses the MIT license. Fork this repo or download it and make your own.

## Tests
No tests necessary. Note that since this is a static site without a backend, if there are components such as feedback forms, they are for demo only.
