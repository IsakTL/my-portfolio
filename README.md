This is a showcase of projects I've created. It uses a vite frontend, deployed via Netlify as a static site.

## Instructions
No installation necessary. Click on [this link](#) to access it.

## Usage
Click around the site to see why I've been an asset to every former employer.

## Contributing
If you'd like to model your own portfolio after mine, feel free. This app uses the MIT license. Fork this repo or download it and make your own.

## Tests
No tests necessary. Note that since this is a static site without a backend, if there are components such as feedback forms, they are for demo only.
